      <description>This post was expanded into a conference paper presented at AISTATS 2019: “On Multi-Cause Causal Inference with Unobserved Confounding: Counterexamples, Impossibility, and Alternatives” (https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10286).
 Last updated 2018-07-24.
 Note: This post is the second in a series motivated by several recent papers about causal inference from observational data when there are multiple causes or treatments being assessed and there is unobserved confounding. See the first post here.
 Goal In observational causal inference, unobserved confounding is a constant threat to drawing valid causal inferences.</description>
